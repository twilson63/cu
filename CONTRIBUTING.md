## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Zig 0.15.1 or later
- Node.js 16+ (for running the demo)
- Python 3 (for local web server)
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cu.git
cd cu

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Build the project
./build.sh

# Run the demo locally
cd demo
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src/          # Zig source code
â”œâ”€â”€ demo/         # Web demo files
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/         # Pre-built binaries
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/         # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/     # Example code
â””â”€â”€ scripts/      # Build and utility scripts
```

## Coding Standards

### Zig Code Style

- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Use PascalCase for types and structs
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names

Example:
```zig
pub fn create_external_table(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !*ExternalTable {
    // Allocate memory for the table
    const table = try allocator.create(ExternalTable);
    table.* = ExternalTable{
        .id = next_table_id,
        .data = StringHashMap([]const u8).init(allocator),
    };
    next_table_id += 1;
    return table;
}
```

### JavaScript Code Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Use const/let instead of var
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Follow the existing code style

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Load Cu WASM module
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} Success status
 */
export async function loadLuaWasm() {
    const response = await fetch('./lua.wasm');
    // ... implementation
}
```

## Testing

- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test in multiple browsers
- Test error cases

## Documentation

- Update the README if needed
- Add JSDoc comments to new functions
- Update API documentation for new features
- Include examples for new functionality

## Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits. Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Test additions/changes
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat(ext-table): add support for nested tables

Implemented recursive serialization for nested table structures.
This allows users to store complex data hierarchies.

Closes #123
```
