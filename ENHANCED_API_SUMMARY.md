   - Bytecode validation for security

2. **Batch Operations**
   - 1000+ operations per second throughput
   - Atomic transactions with rollback support
   - Automatic optimization based on data size
   - Progress callbacks for long operations

3. **Advanced Querying**
   - B-tree and hash indexing
   - Multiple query operators (=, !=, <, >, contains, etc.)
   - Range queries and pagination
   - Automatic query optimization

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Intelligent caching system
   - Adaptive compression (2:1 to 5:1 ratio)
   - Memory-efficient batch processing
   - Index-based query acceleration

### Technical Specifications
- **Memory Usage**: < 1.8MB for typical workloads
- **Function Size**: Up to 100KB bytecode per function
- **Batch Size**: 10,000 operations maximum
- **Query Performance**: < 10ms for indexed queries on 10K+ records
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 79+, Safari 13.1+

## 📊 Implementation Strategy
