## 🎯 What Was Done

**Issue**: WASM functions weren't exported (compute(), init(), etc.)  
**Solution**: Used Zig's `export fn` keyword  
**Result**: ✅ Build successful, functions marked for export

### Key Changes
- 6 functions converted to `export fn` in `src/main.zig`
- Zig 0.15 compatibility fixes across 7 files
- WASM binary rebuilt: `web/lua.wasm` (1644 KB)
- All documentation created

---

## ✅ Verification

### Build Status
```bash
✅ Compilation: Success (0 errors, 0 warnings)
✅ Binary: Created (1644 KB, valid WASM)
✅ Build Time: ~40 seconds
```

### Files Changed
```
Modified:  7 files (main.zig, lua.zig, etc.)
Created:   3 documentation files
Backed Up: 2 files (main.zig.backup, lua.zig.backup)
```

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 6)
1. Investigate export accessibility
2. Test JavaScript integration
3. Verify compute() function works

### Timeline
```
Next Phase:  Export accessibility testing
Estimated:   2-4 hours
Status:      Ready to start
```
